# Linear-Regression-with-Gradient-Descent-
This is my first machine learning model. The previous one was not a complete machine learning model. Here I have developed a linear regression model using gradient decent algorithm. Basically, the main task of this model is to bring the optimized value by adjusting the value of  m and c.
